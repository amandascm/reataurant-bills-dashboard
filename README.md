# Restaurant Bills Dashboard

A project developed by [Amanda Moraes](https://github.com/amandascm) and [Tales Alves](https://github.com/tta13) to practice the development process of data visualizations.

## Goals

- Describe the investigations performed on the data to identify curiosities
- Build a Plotly dashboard with visualizations based on the result of the initial exploration
- Describe the facts learned from the visualizations about the data

## Data

The database proposed for the development of the dashboard is the [Plotly built-in dataset named Tips](https://plotly.com/python-api-reference/generated/plotly.data.html#module-plotly.data).

## Development, Dashboard and Results

The [tips-plotly.ipynb](tips_plotly.ipynb) file in this repo contains all the source code used to explore, identify curiosities and define main questions about the data, besides the achieved results and the code used to build a Dash app to render the Plotly dashboard.

Guidelines to better understand the [tips-plotly.ipynb](tips-plotly.ipynb) file:

- The questions/tasks raised in the development process are listed in the **Exploratory Data Analysis/Investigation** section

- The notebook cell with the dashboard implementation that must be executed for its visualization is in the **Dashboard** section

- To be able to run the dashboard cell with no execution errors, run all cells from the beginning of the file sequentially

- The curiosities, conclusions and prints obtained from the tasks and visualizations are in the **Conclusions and Curiosities** section


## Conclusion

This short project report summarizes essential steps in the data visualization development process. Behind the resulting dashboard there is an iterative sequency of procedures as exploratory data analysis, scope and attributes selection, curiosities and questions gathering, choice of appropriate visual channels and visualization composition, which combined help to achieve a successful communication with users.
